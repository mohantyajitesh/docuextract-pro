# DocuExtract Pro - Complete Product & Go-To-Market Plan

## Product Vision

**DocuExtract Pro** transforms how small businesses and professionals handle document processing. It's a desktop application that extracts structured data from any document—PDFs, scanned images, contracts, invoices—using AI that runs entirely on your computer.

### The End Result for Customers

When a customer uses DocuExtract Pro, they get:

```
INPUT: Any document (PDF, scanned image, photo)
  ↓
  ↓  [ AI Processing - 100% Local & Private ]
  ↓
OUTPUT:
  ├── Extracted Text (searchable, copy-paste ready)
  ├── Tables (structured, exportable to Excel)
  ├── Key-Value Pairs (invoice numbers, dates, amounts, names)
  ├── Signatures (detected, validated, with confidence scores)
  └── Export Options (JSON, CSV, Excel, Markdown)
```

**Real-world example:**
- Drop a scanned invoice → Get: vendor name, invoice #, date, line items table, total amount, payment terms—all extracted and ready to paste into accounting software.

## Pricing Strategy

### Pricing Tiers

| **Professional** | $99 | Consultants, small teams | Unlimited docs, 2 computers, commercial use |
| **Business** | $199 | Small businesses | Unlimited docs, 5 computers, priority support |

4. **One-time vs Subscription**: Compare to "$99 once vs $20/month = $240/year"
